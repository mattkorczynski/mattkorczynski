ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Matt Korczynski - currently operating in Wroclaw ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± . Nevertheless, I have been writting code in many other places - ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡® ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­

Most of my projects are private. 
Public part of my repo mainly consists of playing results with different technologies or basement projects.

ðŸ‘€ My interests are hanging around data processing and analyzing. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently growing up with Python and Rust.
